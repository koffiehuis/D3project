# Day 1
Proposal: I had to write a new proposal. Due to time I decided not to try to find a subject which was relevant to my bachelor's. I found a dataset with energy statistics, and quite a large one at that. This is what I will be using for this project.


# Day 2
Design doc: This day I made a design for my page. I decided to divide the methodological design in 3 categories; Preprocessing, Initializing and Updating. I also came up with a layout for the 4 charts I'm going to implement (worldmap, pie, 2xLinechart).

# Day 3
Prototype: Made a working navbar and included a dropdown selection tag in the navbar. This dropdown will be used to choose the category of engery source shown in the world map. Furthermore, I divided the charts page into SVG (in html).

# Day 4
Prototype: Implemented the SVG elements in D3 instead of html, made sure the location and size of SVGs is dependent of windowsize. Also implemented a slider (this one is not linked to anything yet).
