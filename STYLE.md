# Stylesheet

Rules:

1. Use camelCase for every variable name and start every variable name with a letter.
2. Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas.
3. Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks.
4. General rules for complex (compound) statements:

  * Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
  * Use one space before the opening bracket.
  * Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
  * Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.

  If a statement is very simple the statement is on one line between the brackets.

5. Line length < 80 characters.
6. Comments should start with a capital letter, but a dot at the end is not necessary.
7. Always use the same amount of quotation marks for strings.
8. Each method should be on its own indented line.
9. If possible, a variable should have a self-explanatory name. If not, variables should have logical names.
10. More complex functions should have a name and should be placed just before the closing bracket.

We agree with all rules, except for the lower case file names. We all use lower case if possible, but otherwise we use camelCase for our file names.

The rest of the rules we thought of ourselves.
