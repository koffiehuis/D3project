    <h1>About this project</h1><br>
    <p>Nowadays, as the effects of climate changes become more and more visible, renewable energy is becoming an increasingly important source of energy. But how big is the contribution of renewable sources to our electricity supply when compared to our traditional sources? Are 'outdated' energy sources such as oil and coal decreasing? In which countries are the most rapid changes being made? Take a look at the charts and find out for yourself!
<p><br></p><p>To change the category, use the dropdown menu at the top of the page or click a slice of the pie-chart.<br>Countries can be selected by clicking on the world map and to see the data for a specific year, use the slider!
