##### Problem
We all know the population is growing rapidly worldwide. However, the impact of this growth on our mental well-being is less clear. Even more so, when talking about 'far-away' countries and different cultures. 

##### Solution
Vizualizing populations and suicides alone will not help with providing a clear picture. For this reason, I think a worldmap showing the correlation between growth in population and suicide rates is necessary for providing a clear picture.

## Prerequisites
### Datasource:
* [This dataset](/data/population) from [the world bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL) which consists of the total population for every country from 1960 to 2016. Data from 1960 to 1989 will be excluded. 
* [This dataset](/data/suicide) from [this page](https://ourworldindata.org/suicide) consists off suicide rates for every country from 1990 to 2016.

### Libraries:
* [Datamaps] will be needed for the worldmaps
* [D3js] will be needed for the correlation plots and linecharts

### Similar:
* The worldmaps with slider will be similar to [this](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?view=map) worldmap
