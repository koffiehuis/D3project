# Description
<img src="docs/project_page.png" align="right" height="200" >This project shows the change in sources of electricity production. It does so, by showing changes in sources per country (worldmap), per region (line-chart), in relationship to eachother (pie-chart) and over time (line-chart).  
Three settings are used to specify which data is shown:
* Country: by clicking a country on the worldmap.
* Year:  by using the year-slider.
* Energy-source: by using either the dropdown-menu or clicking on the pie-chart.

# Design
There are six situations where functions are called:
* The window loads
* The window-size is adjusted
* Dropdown menu is used
* Year-slider is used
* A slice of the pie-chart is clicked (same effect as dropdown-menu)
* A country of the worldmap is clicked

These actions are represented in the flowchart below.
